## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!
Hey there! I'm Miranda. Through this project, I want to create a digital showcase of my skills, projects, and experiences in front-end development. I'm also testing my knowledge while continuing to learn new ones.





## ðŸš€ About Me

As a front-end developer, I specialize in JavaScript, TypesScript, HTML5 and SASS with proficiency in frameworks like React. I hold a [Postgraduate Course](https://www.esat.es/estudios/postgrado-especializado-en-diseno-y-desarrollo-web-front-end/) specialize in **FrontEnd Development and UX/UI Design**. I'm dedicated to honing my skills and gaining practical experience, furthering my learning through real-world projects. Check out my GitHub profile for a comprehensive view of my coding journey.
